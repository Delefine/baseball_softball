	<p>When comparing pitching between baseball and softball the first noticeable thing is how the windups are significantly different. In baseball, it's an overhand throw to pitch and they are sixty feet away from home plate. But, in softball, they pitch an underhand throw and are pitching from forty-three
	feet away. Although people think baseball is harder from the looks at it with the distance of everything because it's so much longer/bigger, there is a lot of different aspects that go into it.</p>
	<p>Although baseball pitchers reach a higher velocity, with softball being a shorter distance the speeds and reaction times are very comparable. Another difference between the two sports is that baseball players are pitching off of an elevated mound as opposed to softball players from even ground in a
	circle. The main pitches that were thrown in softball consist of a fastball,
	changeup, curveball, and a rise and drop ball. In baseball, the most common
	pitches are a four-seam fastball, a two-seam fastball, a curveball, a
	slider, and a changeup.</p>
	<p>Another big impact on the difference between pitching in baseball or softball is the size of the ball. Baseballs are white with red seams and softball are yellow with red seams. The size of a baseball is nine inches (in circumference) and a softball is ten inches (in circumference). With the baseball being smaller it's easier to hold onto and this makes it easier with different grips allowing them to have many types of pitches to throw compared to softball. But pitches like the drop and rise ball in softball
	are movements baseball players don't see.</p>
